# Memory Bank & Agile Integration

## Context
- When initializing new projects or features
- When documenting project progress and architecture
- When transitioning between development sessions
- When managing project knowledge across time
- When starting ANY task (MUST read ALL relevant files)
- When beginning or ending a development session

## Requirements
- Store all project documentation in the `.ai` folder with a clear structure
- Use stories as the central focus of development work
- Update documentation at specific trigger points (especially session start/end)
- Follow sequential workflow for project initialization and development
- Use consistent templates for all documentation
- Read ALL relevant files at the start of EVERY task
- Follow TDD approach for all implementation work
- Run and document all test results before completing stories

## Structure
```
.ai/
├── project/                # Core project documentation
│   ├── 01-project-requirements.md    # Project Requirements Document
│   ├── 02-architecture.md            # Architecture documentation
│   ├── 03-project-structure.md       # Project structure documentation
│   └── 04-deployment-config.md       # Deployment configuration
├── stories/               # Central development focus
│   ├── story-001-login.story.md
│   ├── story-002-profile.story.md

```

## Templates
The following standardized templates MUST be used:

1. **Project Requirements Document** (.ai/project/01-project-requirements.md)
   - Use template: `.cursor/templates/project-requirements.md`
   - Must include: Introduction, Goals, Features, Epic Structure, Story List
   - Requires "status: approved" before proceeding

2. **Architecture** (.ai/project/02-architecture.md)
   - Use template: `.cursor/templates/architecture.md`
   - Must include: Technical Summary, Technology Table, Diagrams, Project Structure
   - Requires "status: approved" before proceeding

3. **Stories** (.ai/stories/story-NNN-description.story.md)
   - Use template: `.cursor/templates/story.md`
   - Must include: User Story format, Status, Tasks, Estimation
   - Tasks must follow TDD approach (tests first)
   - Each story must be approved before implementation
   - Stories are the PRIMARY working documents

4. **Status Update** (.ai/status/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
   - Created at the end of each development session
   - Documents: Development Steps, Key Decisions, Next Steps
   - References current and next stories
   - Replaces redundant progress tracking

5. **Active Context** (.ai/status/active-context.md)
   - Updated at the beginning and end of each session
   - Contains current focus, decisions, and challenges
   - Always references the current story

## File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for all documentation files
- Add numerical prefixes (01-, 02-) for files with sequential relationships
- Use descriptive names that reflect content
- Stories should follow the format: `story-NNN-description.story.md`
- Status updates should follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Session Management

### Start Session Process
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start Session] --> ReadStatus[Read latest status update]
    ReadStatus --> CheckStory[Identify current story]
    CheckStory --> ReadContext[Read active-context.md]
    ReadContext --> ReadStory[Read current story in detail]
    ReadStory --> ReadRelevant[Read other relevant files]
    ReadRelevant --> BeginWork[Begin development work]
```

### End Session Process
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    End[End Session] --> UpdateStory[Update current story status]
    UpdateStory --> CreateStatus[Create new status/YYYY-MM-DD.md]
    CreateStatus --> DocumentSteps[Document development steps]
    DocumentSteps --> DocumentDecisions[Document key decisions]
    DocumentDecisions --> DocumentNext[Document next steps]
    DocumentNext --> UpdateContext[Update active-context.md]
```

### Status Update Template
```markdown
# Status Update: YYYY-MM-DD

## Development Steps
1. `path/to/file.ts`: What was changed
   - Details of the change
   - Purpose of the change

## Key Decisions
- Decision 1: Rationale and trade-offs
- Decision 2: Rationale and trade-offs

## Next Steps
1. Continue Story X: Specific tasks
2. Prepare Story Y: Clarify requirements
3. Address potential challenges

## Story References
- Current Story: [Story Title](../stories/story-NNN-title.story.md)
- Next Story: [Story Title](../stories/story-MMM-title.story.md)
```

## Examples
<example>
✅ Starting a session with `start-session` to review latest status
✅ Creating a new project with `.ai/project/01-project-requirements.md` first
✅ Making stories the central focus of all development work
✅ Creating status updates at the end of each session
✅ Following TDD by writing tests before implementation
✅ Creating stories with proper format: "As a ___, I want ___, so that ___"
✅ Ending a session with `end-session` to document progress
</example>

<example type="invalid">
❌ Starting a task without reviewing the current story and status
❌ Starting development without completing 01-project-requirements.md and getting approval
❌ Creating inconsistent documentation structures
❌ Creating documentation without using the required templates
❌ Using inconsistent file naming (mixing camelCase and kebab-case)
❌ Ending a session without creating a status update
❌ Marking stories as complete without all tests passing
❌ Working without referencing the current story
</example>

## Critical Rules
  - STORIES are the PRIMARY working documents and central focus of development
  - Start each session with `start-session` to review latest status and current story
  - End each session with `end-session` to document progress and next steps
  - Always initialize project with complete 01-project-requirements.md before starting development
  - 01-project-requirements.md and 02-architecture.md must have "status: approved" before proceeding with stories
  - MUST use established templates (.cursor/templates/*) for all documentation
  - MUST follow file naming conventions (kebab-case with numerical prefixes where appropriate)
  - Update active-context.md at every session transition
  - Create daily status updates to track progress (replaces redundant progress tracking)
  - Follow sequential workflow: requirements → architecture → stories → implementation
  - Follow TDD approach: write tests first, then implement, ensure tests pass
  - Create stories in proper format: "As a ___, I want ___, so that ___"
  - Never mark a story complete until all tests pass and documentation is updated
