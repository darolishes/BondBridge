## Current Technical Debt ðŸ“Š

### High Priority

- Initial project structure needs refactoring to feature-based organization
  - Impact: Increasing complexity as features are added
  - Resolution: Implement during Sprint 2

### Medium Priority

- Type definitions needed for Redux store with persistence

  - Impact: Potential type safety issues during development
  - Resolution: Create comprehensive type system for store

- Performance optimization for card animations
  - Impact: Potential UI lag on low-end devices
  - Resolution: Implement worklet-based animations and test on various devices

### Low Priority

- Documentation of component API interfaces

  - Impact: Slower onboarding for new developers
  - Resolution: Add JSDoc comments to all exported components

- Test coverage below target for new components
  - Impact: Potential regression bugs
  - Resolution: Increase test coverage during development

## Monitoring ðŸ“ˆ

### Performance Metrics

- App startup time (target: <2s on mid-range devices)
- Animation frame rate (target: 60fps)
- Memory usage (target: <100MB in normal usage)
- Battery consumption (target: <5% per hour of active usage)

### Code Quality Metrics

- Test coverage (target: >80%)
- Code complexity (target: <15 cyclomatic complexity)
- Bundle size (target: <5MB)
- Type safety coverage (target: 100%)

## Risk Assessment ðŸŽ¯

### Current Risks

- Complex animations may affect performance on low-end devices

  - Probability: Medium
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Implement performance testing on various devices

- Redux store size may grow large with extensive card collections

  - Probability: Medium
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Implement selective persistence and state normalization

- Navigation structure complexity as features increase
  - Probability: Low
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Establish clear navigation patterns early

### Mitigation Strategies

- Regular technical debt reviews (bi-weekly)
- Sprint allocation for debt reduction (10% of each sprint)
- Automated quality checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency updates (monthly)
- Performance testing on various device profiles
