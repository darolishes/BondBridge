## Architecture Decisions üèóÔ∏è

### Feature-Based Folder Structure

- Date: 2025-03-26
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: High
- Rationale:
  - Better code organization
  - Improved developer experience
  - Easier feature isolation
- Implementation:
  - Group related components, screens, and logic by feature
  - Shared utilities in common folder
  - Feature-specific types and constants
- Alternatives Considered:
  - Type-based organization (components, screens, etc.)
  - Domain-driven design
- Risks:
  - Initial refactoring effort
  - Potential duplication of code

### React Native with Expo

- Date: 2025-03-25
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: High
- Rationale:
  - Rapid development capabilities
  - Cross-platform support
  - Strong community and ecosystem
- Alternatives Considered:
  - Flutter
  - Native development
- Risks:
  - Expo limitations
  - Native module integration complexity

### Redux Toolkit with RTK Query

- Date: 2025-03-26
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: High
- Rationale:
  - Predictable state management
  - Built-in dev tools and middleware
  - TypeScript support

- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: Medium
- Rationale:
  - Simple key-value storage
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Async operations support
  - Seamless Redux integration
- Implementation:
  - Persist entire store or selected slices
  - Rehydration strategies for startup
  - Migration handling for updates
- Alternatives Considered:
  - SQLite
  - Realm
  - MMKV Storage
- Risks:
  - Storage size limitations
  - Complex query limitations
  - Migration complexity
