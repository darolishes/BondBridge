## Architecture Decisions üèóÔ∏è

### Feature-Based Folder Structure

- Date: 2025-03-26
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: High
- Rationale:
  - Better code organization
  - Improved developer experience
  - Easier feature isolation
- Implementation:
  - Group related components, screens, and logic by feature
  - Shared utilities in common folder
  - Feature-specific types and constants
- Alternatives Considered:
  - Type-based organization (components, screens, etc.)
  - Domain-driven design
- Risks:
  - Initial refactoring effort
  - Potential duplication of code

### React Native with Expo

- Date: 2025-03-25
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: High
- Rationale:
  - Rapid development capabilities
  - Cross-platform support
  - Strong community and ecosystem
- Alternatives Considered:
  - Flutter
  - Native development
- Risks:
  - Expo limitations
  - Native module integration complexity

### Redux Toolkit with RTK Query

- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: High
- Rationale:
  - Predictable state management
  - Built-in dev tools and middleware
  - TypeScript support
  - Simplified data fetching with RTK Query
- Implementation:
  - Redux Persist for offline state
  - Selective persistence for performance
  - RTK Query for potential future API integration
- Alternatives Considered:
  - MobX
  - Context API only
  - Zustand
- Risks:
  - Learning curve for new developers
  - Potential over-engineering for simple states

### AsyncStorage with Redux Persist

- Date: 2025-03-26
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: Medium
- Rationale:
  - Simple key-value storage
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Async operations support
  - Seamless Redux integration
- Implementation:
  - Persist entire store or selected slices
  - Rehydration strategies for startup
  - Migration handling for updates
- Alternatives Considered:
  - SQLite
  - Realm
  - MMKV Storage
- Risks:
  - Storage size limitations
  - Complex query limitations
  - Migration complexity

### Conversation Card Data Model

- Date: 2025-03-26
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: High
- Rationale:
  - Comprehensive data structure for conversation cards
  - Support for various difficulty levels
  - Categorization capabilities
  - Follow-up questions support
- Implementation:
  - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - Card categories as union type
  - Support for metadata like seen status and favorites
- Alternatives Considered:
  - Simpler model without follow-up questions
  - External schema validation (Zod)
- Risks:
  - Migration complexity for future changes
  - Performance with large datasets

## UI/UX Decisions üé®

### Custom Card Animation System

- Date: 2025-03-26
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: High
- Rationale:
  - Fine-grained control over animations
  - Optimized performance
  - Unique user experience
- Implementation:
  - React Native Reanimated 3
  - Gesture Handler for swipe detection
  - Worklet-based animation logic
- Alternatives Considered:
  - Third-party card swiper libraries
  - Basic Animated API
- Risks:
  - Implementation complexity
  - Performance on low-end devices

### Single Card View vs Card List

- Date: 2025-03-26
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: High
- Rationale:
  - Better focus on individual conversation prompts
  - More immersive experience
  - Alignment with project brief requirements
  - Tinder-like swiping mechanism familiar to users
- Implementation:
  - CardDeck component showing current and next card
  - Swipe gestures for navigation
  - Visual cues for swipe direction
- Alternatives Considered:
  - List-based card view with tapping
  - Grid layout for multiple cards
- Risks:
  - More complex animation requirements
  - Potentially higher memory usage

### Category Filter System

- Date: 2025-03-26
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: Medium
- Rationale:
  - Allows targeting specific conversation topics
  - Enhances discovery
  - Prevents repetitive content
- Implementation:
  - Filter panel with toggleable category options
  - Visual distinction between categories
  - Redux state management for filter persistence
- Alternatives Considered:
  - Tag-based filtering
  - Search functionality only
- Risks:
  - UI complexity
  - Performance with many filters applied

### Difficulty Level Visualization

- Date: 2025-03-26
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: Medium
- Rationale:
  - Clear indication of conversation depth
  - Progressive difficulty for couples
  - Visual feedback for challenge level
- Implementation:
  - 1-5 scale visualized as dots or stars
  - Color coding for quick recognition
  - Filter by difficulty level
- Alternatives Considered:
  - Text-only difficulty indicators
  - Hidden difficulty levels
- Risks:
  - Subjective nature of difficulty assessment
  - Filtering may limit content variety

### Minimalist Design with Dark Mode

- Date: 2025-03-25
- Status: ‚úÖ Approved
- Impact: Medium
- Rationale:
  - Better user experience
  - Reduced eye strain
  - Modern aesthetic
- Implementation:
  - Theme system with CSS-in-JS
