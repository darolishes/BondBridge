## Upcoming Tasks 📋

### High Priority

1. Implement Card detail screens
2. Set up Redux store with AsyncStorage persistence
3. Optimize navigation transitions
4. Create advanced card component with animations
5. Add user settings screens

### Medium Priority

1. Set up testing framework
2. Create card data schema
3. Implement card swiping prototype
4. Create category filtering system
5. Add accessibility features to core components

## Blockers/Risks ⚠️

- Performance concerns for complex card animations on low-end devices
- Type safety across the Redux store with persistence
- Integration of complex card components with the theme system
