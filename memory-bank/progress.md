## Upcoming Tasks 📋

### High Priority

1. Refactor to feature-based folder structure
2. Set up Redux store with AsyncStorage persistence
3. Implement navigation framework
4. Create card component prototypes
5. Implement theming system with dark mode support

### Medium Priority

1. Set up testing framework
2. Create card data schema
3. Implement card swiping prototype
4. Create category filtering system
5. Add accessibility features to core components

## Blockers/Risks ⚠️

- Performance concerns for complex card animations on low-end devices
- Type safety across the Redux store with persistence
- Navigation integration with theme system
