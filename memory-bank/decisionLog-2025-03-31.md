# Decision Log - 2025-03-31

## Component Architecture Decisions

- **Decision:** Adopt atomic design methodology for component organization
- **Rationale:** Provides a clear structure for component hierarchy and promotes reusability
- **Impact:** Improved developer experience and more consistent UI
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Implement NativeWind for styling
- **Rationale:** Provides utility-first styling approach with good performance and developer experience
- **Impact:** Faster styling development and more consistent UI
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Create a comprehensive theme system
- **Rationale:** Centralizes design tokens and ensures consistency across the app
- **Impact:** Easier maintenance and updates to the design system
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Use compound components pattern for complex UI elements
- **Rationale:** Provides flexible and intuitive API for complex components
- **Impact:** More maintainable and adaptable component architecture
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Implement render props pattern for interactive components
- **Rationale:** Allows for maximum flexibility in component rendering while encapsulating behavior
- **Impact:** More reusable interaction patterns and cleaner component APIs
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Adopt a structured directory organization for components
- **Rationale:** Improves discoverability and organization of components
- **Impact:** Easier navigation and maintenance of the codebase
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Prioritize accessibility in component design
- **Rationale:** Ensures the app is usable by all users and complies with accessibility standards
- **Impact:** Improved user experience for all users and potential regulatory compliance
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Implement performance optimizations early
- **Rationale:** Prevents performance issues from accumulating as the app grows
- **Impact:** Better user experience and easier maintenance
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Separate business logic from UI components using custom hooks
- **Rationale:** Improves testability and reusability of business logic
- **Impact:** More maintainable codebase with clearer separation of concerns
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

## Implementation Decisions

- **Decision:** Create a phased approach for component implementation
- **Rationale:** Allows for focused development and testing of core components first
- **Impact:** More efficient use of development resources and clearer milestones
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Use FlashList for virtualized lists
- **Rationale:** Provides better performance than FlatList for long lists
- **Impact:** Improved scrolling performance and reduced memory usage
- **Date:** 2025-03-31

- **Decision:** Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- **Rationale:** Reduces initial load time and improves performance
- **Impact:** Better user experience with faster initial rendering
- **Date:** 2025-03-31
