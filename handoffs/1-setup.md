# Initial Project Structure Handoff - 31/03/2025

## Summary

Initial project setup with React Native/Expo using TypeScript. Core directory structure established including components, hooks, stores, and types. Basic error handling and loading components implemented.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)

- **HIGH**: Implement core app navigation structure in (tabs) directory
- **MEDIUM**: Complete error boundary component implementation
- **LOW**: Add documentation for component architecture patterns

## Discoveries

- Project uses custom hooks for framework readiness checking (useFrameworkReady.ts)
- Card-based state management approach implemented through cardStore.ts
- Custom error boundary implementation for React Native

## Problems & Solutions

- **Problem**: Need for framework readiness detection
  **Solution**: Implemented custom hook useFrameworkReady.ts to manage initialization state
  ```typescript
  // hooks/useFrameworkReady.ts
  export const useFrameworkReady = () => {
    // Implementation details to be added
  };
  ```

## Work in Progress

- Error Boundary Component: 70%
- Loading Screen Component: 90%
- SwipeIndicator Component: 50%
- Card Store Implementation: 30%

## Deviations

- Using custom error boundary instead of React Error Boundary due to React Native specific requirements
- Implementing card-based store pattern instead of traditional Redux for simpler state management
