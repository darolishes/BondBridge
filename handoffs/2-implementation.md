# BondBridge Project Handoff - 31/03/2025

## Summary

BondBridge is a React Native/Expo application designed to promote meaningful communication between couples through conversation cards. The project has established its core structure with key components for card interaction, error handling, and loading states. The app uses Zustand for state management, React Native Reanimated for animations, and follows a card-based UI pattern.

## Current Project Status

The project has implemented:

- Basic app structure with tab-based navigation (Cards, Progress, Settings)
- Core components: ErrorBoundary, LoadingScreen, SwipeIndicator
- Card store with mock data and swipe functionality
- Main card screen with animation and gesture handling

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)

- **HIGH**: Complete the Progress and Settings screens
- **MEDIUM**: Implement category filtering functionality
- **MEDIUM**: Add proper error handling for edge cases
- **LOW**: Implement offline data persistence improvements

## Discoveries

- The project uses a sophisticated card interaction system with gesture-based swiping
- Custom animation patterns are implemented using React Native Reanimated
- The app follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Card data is structured with categories and optional sub-questions

## Problems & Solutions

- **Problem**: Need for smooth card transitions and animations
  **Solution**: Implemented custom gesture handling with React Native Reanimated and GestureHandler

- **Problem**: State management for card progression
  **Solution**: Created a Zustand store with AsyncStorage persistence

## Work in Progress

- Card Screen: 90% complete
- Progress Screen: 20% complete
- Settings Screen: 10% complete
- Card Store Implementation: 70% complete
- Error Boundary Component: 90% complete
- Loading Screen Component: 100% complete
- SwipeIndicator Component: 90% complete

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Progress Screen**:

   - Implement visualization of card history
   - Add statistics on categories explored
   - Create progress indicators

2. **Develop Settings Screen**:

   - Add category filtering options
   - Implement reset functionality
   - Add about/help information

3. **Enhance Card Interaction**:

   - Improve haptic feedback
   - Add card history navigation
   - Implement favorites functionality

4. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Implement proper error handling for AsyncStorage operations
   - Add unit tests for core components
   - Optimize animations for performance
