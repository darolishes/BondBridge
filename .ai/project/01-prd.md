- NativeWind for styling
- React Native Reanimated for animations
- AsyncStorage for data persistence

### Technical Implementation Details

#### nativecn-ui Integration

```typescript
// Theme configuration
export const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: {
      default: "#FF6B6B",
      hover: "#FF5252",
      pressed: "#FF3838",
    },
    secondary: {
      default: "#4ECDC4",
      hover: "#45B7AF",
      pressed: "#3CA29A",
    },
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: {
      sans: "Inter",
      heading: "Poppins",
    },
  },
};

// Component usage
import { Card, Button } from "nativecn-ui";
```

#### JSON Import Implementation

```typescript
interface ImportService {
  validateJSON(file: File): Promise<boolean>;
  importCardSet(file: File): Promise<CardSet>;
  handleAssets(cardSet: CardSet): Promise<void>;
}

// File system integration
import * as FileSystem from "expo-file-system";
import * as DocumentPicker from "expo-document-picker";
```

#### Asset Management

- Asset naming convention: `${packageName}_${assetId}`
- Supported image formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP
- Maximum image size: 1MB
- Asset storage location: `assets/sets/${packageName}/`
- Fallback strategy for missing assets

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Testing

- Jest for component and utility testing
- React Native Testing Library for component interaction
- Mock implementations for native modules
- Coverage requirement: 80%

#### Integration Testing

- End-to-end testing with Detox
- User flow validation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance benchmarking

#### Accessibility Testing

- VoiceOver (iOS) compatibility
- TalkBack (Android) compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Touch target size requirements
- Screen reader optimization

### Accessibility Standards

1. Screen Reader Support

   - Meaningful labels for all interactive elements
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Image descriptions
   - Custom actions for gestures

2. Visual Considerations

   - Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1
   - Adjustable text size support
   - Color-blind friendly design
   - Focus indicators

3. Interaction

   - Gesture alternatives
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Sufficient timing adjustments

## Data Structure

```typescript
interface CardSet {
  packageName: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  cards: Card[];
}

interface Card {
  id: string;
  category: string;
  question: string;
  followUps: string[];
  difficulty: 1 | 2 | 3;
}
```
