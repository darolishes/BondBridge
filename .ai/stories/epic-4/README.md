# Epic-4: External Card Set Integration

## Description

This epic focuses on allowing users to expand their conversation experience by importing external card sets into BondBridge. It includes features for importing card sets from files, exporting custom sets for sharing, browsing a marketplace of available sets, and ensuring imported sets are properly validated for compatibility.

## Business Value

External card set integration significantly expands the app's content without requiring continuous developer updates. It creates a potential community ecosystem around the app where users can share and discover new conversation topics. This increases the app's long-term value proposition and keeps content fresh and engaging over time.
