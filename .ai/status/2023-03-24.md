# Status Update - March 24, 2023

## Current Focus

- Refactoring the Card component to use a more maintainable and testable architecture
- Implementing comprehensive test coverage for the Card component and its hooks

## Key Findings

- Successfully split the Card component into smaller, more focused files
- Implemented a centralized configuration system for better maintainability
- Created a robust testing suite for the Card component and its hooks

## Proposed Solutions

1. Component Structure:

   - Base component for core rendering logic
   - Custom hook for business logic
   - Centralized types for better type safety
   - Configuration provider for consistent settings

2. Testing Strategy:
   - Unit tests for the useLogic hook
   - Component tests for the Card component
   - Mock configuration for consistent test environment
   - Test coverage for all major features:
     - Flip animation
     - Loading states
     - Custom styles
     - Swipe gestures
     - Accessibility props

## Progress

âœ… Completed:

- Created centralized config directory structure
- Implemented shared constants file
- Set up path aliases configuration
- Migrated theme configuration
- Created ConfigProvider and useConfig hook
- Updated build configurations
- Created utility files for shared styles and animations
- Added comprehensive test suite for useLogic hook
- Added test coverage for all major features

ðŸ”„ In Progress:

- Writing component tests for Card component
- Documenting test patterns for future components

## Next Steps

1. Complete component tests for Card component
2. Add integration tests for Card with ConfigProvider
3. Update documentation with testing guidelines
4. Apply similar testing patterns to other components
5. Set up continuous integration for test automation

## Blockers

None at the moment.

## Notes

- The new configuration system provides a single source of truth for all configuration values
- Shared utilities for styles and animations improve code reuse
- Test coverage ensures reliability of the component's features
- Mock configuration in tests provides consistent test environment
