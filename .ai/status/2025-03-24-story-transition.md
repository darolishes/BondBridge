## Development Steps

1. Story 6 (Card Animation System):

   - Completed core animation features
   - Implemented all planned hooks (flip, swipe, haptic)
   - Added accessibility features
   - Integrated performance monitoring
   - Created comprehensive tests

## Next Steps

1. Story 8 Implementation:

   - Create JSON schema for card sets
   - Implement validation logic
   - Complete import service implementation
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Create user-friendly import UI
   - Add export functionality
   - Write tests for all components

2. Technical Considerations:
   - Ensure secure file handling
