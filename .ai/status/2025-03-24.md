2. Update remaining component tests
3. Review and update import paths
4. Verify component functionality
5. Update Storybook examples
6. Implement retry mechanism for failed imports
7. Add accessibility improvements
8. Create error handling guidelines
9. Set up automated testing pipeline

## Blockers

None at the moment.

## Notes

- New naming convention improves code consistency
- Centralized styles reduce code duplication
- Enhanced type safety through TypeScript
- Better component organization improves maintainability
- All changes follow project standards
- Consider adding more complex interaction stories
- Review performance impact of loading states
- Document best practices for error handling

## Dependencies

- React Native
- TypeScript
- Storybook
- React Native Testing Library (planned)

## Development Steps

1. Implemented Card Set Validation System

   - Created `card-set-schema.ts` with Zod validation
   - Implemented `card-set-validator.ts` service
   - Added comprehensive test coverage
   - Integrated with import flow

2. Created Card Set Import System

   - Implemented `card-set-importer.ts` service
   - Added `card-set-repository.ts` interface
   - Created in-memory repository implementation
   - Added test coverage for import scenarios

3. Enhanced Error Handling

   - Added structured error types
   - Implemented error formatting
   - Added validation error messages
   - Integrated with UI feedback

4. Standardized File Naming
   - Converted to kebab-case naming convention
   - Updated import paths
   - Maintained consistent file structure
   - Added file structure documentation

## Key Decisions

1. Used Zod for schema validation:

   - Type-safe validation
   - Runtime type checking
   - Detailed error messages
   - Easy schema definition

2. Separated concerns:

   - Validation logic in `card-set-validator.ts`
   - Import logic in `card-set-importer.ts`
   - Storage logic in `card-set-repository.ts`
   - Clear responsibility boundaries

3. Error handling approach:

   - Structured error types
   - Consistent error codes
   - User-friendly messages
   - Proper error propagation

4. File naming convention:
   - Adopted kebab-case for all files
   - Consistent with React Native best practices
   - Improved readability
   - Better file organization
