# Status Update: 2025-03-24

## Development Steps

1. `package.json`: Updated dependencies and configuration

   - Added license field to resolve warnings
   - Updated @react-native-async-storage/async-storage to 1.21.0
   - Updated react-native to 0.73.6
   - Added @react-native/babel-preset for Metro compatibility

2. `babel.config.js`: Optimized configuration

   - Removed deprecated expo-router/babel plugin
   - Configured module-resolver for path aliases
   - Updated presets for Expo compatibility

3. `app/_layout.tsx`: Enhanced root layout
   - Implemented splash screen handling
   - Added PaperProvider for theming
   - Configured Stack navigation defaults

## Key Decisions

- Removed expo-router/babel plugin as it's deprecated in SDK 50
- Standardized path aliases across babel and TypeScript configurations
- Chose "UNLICENSED" as the package license for private development
- Updated async-storage and react-native versions for Expo compatibility
- Added @react-native/babel-preset to resolve Metro bundler warnings

## Next Steps

1. Continue with UI implementation:
   - Implement card animations (Story 6)
   - Set up data persistence layer (Story 7)
2. Test routing functionality with new Expo Router setup
3. Address any remaining configuration warnings
