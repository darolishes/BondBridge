   - Added PaperProvider for theming
   - Configured Stack navigation defaults

4. `src/hooks/useCardFlip.ts`: Implemented flip animation hook

   - Added configuration options for duration and physics
   - Implemented spring and timing animation options
   - Added TypeScript types for configuration and results

5. `src/hooks/useCardSwipe.ts`: Created swipe gesture hook

   - Implemented PanResponder for gesture handling
   - Added configurable swipe threshold
   - Implemented position reset functionality

6. `src/hooks/useHapticFeedback.ts`: Added haptic feedback

   - Integrated Expo Haptics
   - Implemented multiple intensity levels
   - Added TypeScript types and configuration

7. `src/components/Card.tsx`: Enhanced Card component

   - Integrated all animation hooks
   - Added accessibility features
   - Implemented performance monitoring
   - Created comprehensive test suite

8. `src/components/__stories__/Card.stories.tsx`: Added Storybook examples

   - Created basic card examples
   - Added interactive animation stories
   - Implemented accessibility examples
   - Added performance monitoring stories

9. `src/components/Card.md`: Created documentation
   - Added detailed API documentation
   - Included usage examples
   - Added best practices section
   - Documented accessibility features

## Key Decisions

- Removed expo-router/babel plugin as it's deprecated in SDK 50
- Standardized path aliases across babel and TypeScript configurations
- Chose "UNLICENSED" as the package license for private development
- Updated async-storage and react-native versions for Expo compatibility
- Added @react-native/babel-preset to resolve Metro bundler warnings
- Used React Native's Animated API for core animations
- Implemented configurable animation options for flexibility
- Added performance monitoring for optimization
- Integrated haptic feedback for better UX
- Created comprehensive documentation and examples
- Added accessibility features including reduced motion support

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Card Animation System tasks:

   - Create animation stress tests
   - Optimize for low-end devices
   - Add animation presets
   - Complete documentation

2. Prepare for Card Set Import System:

   - Review requirements
   - Plan integration points with animation system
   - Design import UI/UX

3. Address performance optimization:
   - Run performance tests
   - Implement optimizations
   - Document best practices
